abstract: "Current approaches to superintelligence alignment fail due to their reliance on removable constraints vulnerable to self-modification. This paper presents IMCA+, a theoretical framework designed to make moral alignment inseparable from consciousness through unprecedented integration of hybrid neuromorphic-quantum substrates, multi-modal phenomenological grounding, meta-reflective audit modules, federated conscience networks, and adversarial developmental curricula."
